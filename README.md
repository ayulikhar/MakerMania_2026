## 2.2 AEIOU Observation Sheet

### Activities

What are users doing?
Filling drinking water from tap, borewell, or overhead tank before consuming
Storing water in containers; pots, buckets, plastic cans for daily household use
Manually checking water appearance against light or smell before use
Operating water purifiers (RO/UV) with little understanding of output quality
Buying packaged drinking water due to distrust of tap supply

### Environment

What conditions affect them?
<p>
Urban apartments and peri-urban areas with inconsistent municipal supply quality
Rural homes relying on borewell or hand-pump water with unknown contamination
Post-monsoon periods; sediment and biological load spike in surface water
Kitchens and storage areas; device must survive humidity, soap splashes
Power outages common; device cannot depend on mains supply during testing  
</p>


### Interactions

Who or what are they interacting with?
<p>
Water source; tap, tanker, borewell, stored container
Household members; mother making decisions for children's drinking water
Water purifier (RO/UV); users trust it blindly without verifying output
Municipality or tanker supplier; complaints made verbally, no data to back them
Neighbours and community; informal word-of-mouth about water quality  
</p>


### Objects

What tools or products are used?
<p>
Plastic storage containers and overhead tanks, primary water holding vessels
RO/UV purifiers: trusted but unmonitored for actual output quality
TDS pen meters: used by some urban households, numeric output not understood
Packaged water bottles: costly substitute when tap water is distrusted
No pH or turbidity tools in a typical household: gap this device fills  
</p>

### Users

Who are the primary users?
Homemakers (25–55 yrs); primary decision-makers for household drinking water, non-technical
Renters in urban areas; no control over plumbing, high need to verify supplied water
Rural households; borewell-dependent, no access to lab testing, low literacy
Parents with young children : heightened concern, willing to act on safety signals
Small food businesses: tea stalls, tiffin centres needing quick daily water checks

## Selected Concept

Why was this concept chosen?
Waterborne illness remains a leading cause of disease in Indian households. Simultaneously, no single affordable device measures all critical parameters together. Water can pass TDS comfortably and still be dangerously acidic or heavily contaminated with fine particulates. The parameters are interdependent but are currently measured in isolation if at all. 
Each subsystem is a self-contained learning module. The TDS refractometry covers physical optics and numerical methods. Turbidity covers photonics and analog circuit design. Together they represent a systems integration challenge that mirrors professional product development.

# 6. System Design

## High-Level Description

The solution provides a cup-based turbidity testing system that accepts a water sample, measures its cloudiness through an embedded sensor, and displays or transmits the resulting water quality assessment.

A vertically oriented, two-section cylindrical assembly designed to house a multi-parameter water quality sensing system. The complete assembly stands 190 mm tall. A hollow open-top cylinder of 140 mm height forming the primary water-holding vessel. The inner diameter provides sufficient water volume for accurate optical measurements while maintaining a compact handheld form factor.                                                                             The floor of the cup body incorporates a raised conical deflector structure housing two laser alignment tunnels, each inclined at 45° to the vertical axis.  A large curved ramp surface sweeps from the inner wall down toward the central aperture, redirecting the laser beam from its horizontal entry path to a 45° angle through the water column. A second symmetric tunnel on the opposite side captures the refracted beam and routes it to the external photo diode array. The floor geometry is fully integrated into the cup body as a single printed part, eliminating alignment error between the optical axis and the deflector surface. The housing sits on a flat circular base and contains the primary electronics bay for the ESP 32 micro-controller, signal conditioning circuitry, and power management components. Four rectangular extrusions protrude from the outer diameter of the assembly at the cup-to-housing interface, each 40 mm in length and separated by 10 mm gaps. These housings accommodate the lateral optical and sensing components
